Date finished: 1/23/17

Estimated number of hours spent: approx. 25 hours

#Project Information
Role: I developed all the classes and methods used in the program. 

Resources: TA office hours were my main source of assistance in this project. I also consulted various online tutorials including tutorialspoint.com and stackoverflow.com.

Files used to start the project: 

Files used to test the project: N/A. I tested the projected by running it in Eclipse.

Data or resources files required: images for the ball and blocks are needed. These can be loaded into the project folder, and are used as .txt files.

#About the Program
How to play: run the program from any of the 4 classes. A console should appear with the game title and two buttons. Clicking the "Help" button will lead you to a page with instructions for game details (specifications, cheat codes, power-ups, etc). Press play to begin the first level!

Bugs and crashes: 
1. Sometimes when the ball comes in at a certain angle and hits the corner of the paddle, the ball will stick to the paddle and move along the edge until it releases on the other side. 
2. Be careful with the speed of the ball. It is dependent on how much time has elapsed, so it gets progressively faster with every level. Especially if you're skipping from level to level by pressing the cheat keys 1-3,  the ball will be moving very quickly. The remedy to this is to counter with the cheat key S that will slow down the ball.
3. The physics of the collisions is not mathematically sound. There should be angles involved in how the ball rebounds off of a surface. The current directions of the ball are just programmed to make a 90 degree change in direction.

Extra features: Your score is dependent on how fast you finish the game. The quicker you are the better! The number of seconds from the start of the game until the end is recorded, and then used to deduct from the points you have accumulated from destroying the blocks.
Cheat codes:
1. Press X to exit back to the home page
2. Press 1, 2, or 3 to go to that specific level
3. Press R to reset the level you're on
4. Press L for more lives
5. Press S to make the ball and blocks slower
6. Press F to make the ball and blocks faster
7. Press W to go to the end of the game and see your results
8. Press P to pause and G to resume

#Impressions
I was initially extremely overwhelmed; I don't think the classes I've taken up to now (namely CS201) really prepared me to dive into this project. We never really did much object oriented programming or saw the intricacies behind how classes and objects and methods all came together. We really only wrote algorithms and methods in that class. I do think that I learned a lot having finished.

Describe at least one variant of Breakout that you thought was interesting and what was interesting about it.
The Vortex variant of Breakout was the most intriguing because it appears to require physics and trigonometry. The circular motion of
the paddle, the ball, and the blocks reminded me of problems from calculus. It seems like the best combination of outside knowledge 
as well as programming. It stimulated thoughts on how to keep the calculations of all the moving components in accordance to angles
and polar coordinates as the game progresses.

Describe a general description of the different levels you intend to build (perhaps with "pictures" of the block configurations)
1. checkered blocks with spaces in between, the bottom most row has the type 1 blocks
2. type 3 blocks in every other row
3. square of type 1 blocks, in the center is a type 2 block

Give several different blocks you want to create
1. takes 3 hits to break
2. if you hit this block the ball will speed up (so people will want to avoid until the end)
3. moving block (side to side)
4. a block that changes position every 10 seconds

Give several different power ups you want to create
1. extra life
2. slow down the ball
3. make the paddle longer
4. skip to the next level

Give several different cheat keys you are planning to include
1. player presses a numeric key (i.e., 1-9), clear the current level and jump to the level corresponding to the number pressed
2. L for extra lives
3. R for reset ball and paddle
4. where the power ups are hidden in this level

Describe something extra you intend to add and why you think it is a substantial addition
- adding a timed component to overall score. number of seconds will be halved and then subtracted from points earned from breaking
the blocks. this is a substantial addition because it gives the player an incentive to be strategic about where he/she is aiming
the ball, as opposed to just randomly pushing it here and there.
